# Blue AId - Volunteer/Admin
This app serves as the admin/volunteer side of Blue Aid. You can login into your volunteer or admin profile. In the volunteer profile, you can see your details and also use the finder that finds the bluetooth devices in the range and tells their approximate distances. In the admin side, you can manage all the volunteers working for your non-profit. You can also broadcast alerts that will be sent to all the users. All the data is encrypted by Base64 encrytption protocol.
